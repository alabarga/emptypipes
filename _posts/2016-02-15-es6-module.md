### Overview

One of the most common scenarios I run into when creating javascript
applications is the following.

1. I start working on some application (let's call it `foo`).

2. I start working on a different program (let's call it `bar`) and need some
of the functionality that I already implemented in `foo`. 

In python, accomplishing this is trivial by placing the source files in the same
directory and saying `import foo`. In javascript, it's a little more
complicated. Rather than recapitulate a lot of existing documentation about the
different ways that one can implement modules in javascript (CommonJS, AMD,
etc...), I'll just dive into how I use `gulp` and `webpack` to take advantage
of the [ECMAScript 6 syntax for
modules](http://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html) to create
reusable javascript components.

#### Goal

The goal of this project is to create two components: `foo` and `bar`. `foo`
will export a function called `drawCircle` that we can import into `bar`. `bar`
will then draw a rectangle on top of the circle.

Here's the code for `app/scripts/bar.js`

```javascript
import d3 from 'd3';
import {drawCircle} from 'foo';

export function drawRectangleAndCircle(divName) {
    drawCircle(divName);

    d3.select('svg')
    .append('rect')
    .attr('x', 75)
    .attr('y', 75)
    .attr('width', 100)
    .attr('height', 100)
    .classed('bar-rectangle', true)
    .attr('opacity', 0.7)
}
```

And the relevant code from `app/index.html` which uses `bar.js`:

```html
 <!-- build:js scripts/bar.js -->
  <script src='scripts/bar.js'></script>
  <!-- endbuild -->

  <script type='text/javascript'>

  bar.drawRectangleAndCircle('#circle');

  </script>
```


In order for all of this to function, we need some tools to manage
which modules we have installed (`npm`), resolve the import statements (`webpack`),
translate the es6 to more universally understandable es5 (`babel`) and to build
everything into one package (`gulp`). The easiest way to get started is to use
[`yeoman`](http://yeoman.io/) to scaffold out the application. To install yeoman, 
simply use `npm`:

```
npm install -g yo
```

Then, install the generator for this tutorial:

```
npm install -g generator-gulp-webpack-es6
```

#### Setting up *foo*

Create a directory to host the `foo` module and scaffold it out:

```bash
mkdir foo
cd foo
yo gulp-webpack-es6
```

When yeoman asks for `Your project name:`, make sure to enter `foo`: 

You can just use the default values for the other fields. The default values for author
name and email address are taken from your `~/.gitconfig` if you have one.

That's it. We now have a module which simply draws a circle in the browser. Witness it
in all its glory by running:

```javascript
gulp serve
```

And pointing your browser to `127.0.0.1:9000`. The result should look like this:

<img src='/img/es6_module/foo_browser.png' width=320 />

Now, we want to install this package locally so that we can import it from our
soon-to-be-created package `bar`. To do this we need to make one minor change
to our `webpack.config.js` by adding the following lines:

```json
  externals: {
      "d3": "d3"
  },
```

These are necessary to tell webpack not to include d3 in the packaged file. Under
normal circumstances this wouldn't be necessary but if I omit it and use `npm link`
as described below, I get the following error:

```text
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'document' of undefined
```

It's seems like it happens either because `webpack` adds a `use strict;`
somewhere in the bundled `foo` package, or because d3 is included in both `foo`
and `bar`. In either case, specifying that it's an external package seems to
resolve the problem.

To build and install `foo` so that it can be imported by other modules, just
run the following two commands.

```bash
gulp build
npm link
```

The first will compile the code into a single javascript file and the second
will install it as a global module on the local computer. From now on, whenever
we need to make changes to `foo` we just need to run `gulp build` and they
will be reflected in every local package that uses `foo`.

#### Setting up *bar*

To create the calling package `bar` we follow a very similar procedure:

```javascript
mkdir bar
cd bar
yo gulp-webpack-es6
```

When yeoman asks for `Your project name:`, make sure to enter `bar`. You can
use the default values for the other fields.

Now because we want to use the functionality provided in `foo`, we need to
install it:

```bash
npm link foo
```

Adn then we need to modify `app/scripts/bar.js` and have it implement
its own functionality:

```
import d3 from 'd3';
import {drawCircle} from 'foo';

export function drawRectangleAndCircle(divName) {
    drawCircle(divName);

    d3.select('svg')
    .append('rect')
    .attr('x', 75)
    .attr('y', 75)
    .attr('width', 100)
    .attr('height', 100)
    .classed('bar-rectangle', true)
    .attr('opacity', 0.7)
}
```

And finally we need to change the `<script>` code inside `index.html` to
call the newly created function from `bar`:

```html
<script type='text/javascript'>

bar.drawRectangleAndCircle('#circle');

</script>
```

If everything worked as it should, running `gulp serve` should show a lovely
circle / square combination:

<img src="img/es6_module/bar_browser.png" width=320 />


#### Generator directory structure 

The directory structure of the componenets generated using `gulp-webpackes6`
is organized so that the configuration files are in the root directory, all of
the code is in the `app` subdirectory, unit tests are in `test` and the compiled
javascript is in `dist`:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── scripts
│   │   ├── foo.js
│   │   └── helper_module.js
│   └── styles
│       └── foo.css
├── bower.json
├── dist
│   ├── index.html
│   └── scripts
│       └── foo.js
├── gulpfile.babel.js
├── package.json
└── webpack.config.js
```


#### Changing the module's name

The default module is created so that the main file is in
`app/scripts/module_name.js` where `module_name` is the name given in the
generator questionnaire. To change it to something else, you can either re-run
the generator or make the following changes:

* Rename `app/scripts/module_name.js`
* Change occurences of `module_name` in `app/index.html`
* Change the `entry` line in `webpack.config.js`
