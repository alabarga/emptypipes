<h1>Layouts Upon Layouts</h1>

One of the truly beautiful things about d3.js is how easy it is to combine
multiple layouts into one graphic. The example presented below combines
three different layout to data along *** dimensions of data:

1. RNA secondary structure. RNA is a molecule similar to DNA with the property
that it folds back onto itself to form pairs with bases in its own sequence.
Its secondary structure is often displayed as an eponymous diagram.

2. Some quantity associated with each molecule. We can display this by scaling
the secondary structure diagrams using a treemap layout.

3. Multiples of the above quantities.

We can display all of this information in one plot by combining three different
layouts: an <a href="https://github.com/pkerpedjiev/rnaplot">rnaplot</a> layout
to display the secondary structure of an RNA, a <a
href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063582">treemap</a> to display the relative
quantities, and a <a href="https://github.com/interactivethings/d3-grid">grid
layout</a> to arrange the individual images.
