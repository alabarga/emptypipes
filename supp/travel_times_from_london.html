Travel times from London by train. The most accessible regions often lie
along highways, but not all towns along a highway are equally accessible.
This is likely due to the fact that major train links are also serviced by
large roads (the rail lines are not displayed very prominently on open
street maps). Click anywhere on the map to get the distance from the start as well as the 
estimated travel time by train.

The origin of this map is described in slightly more detail <a
    href="/2015/03/25/train-travel-times-in-europe-map/">in another blog
    post.</a> The zoomable version shown here was created by overlaying the image created
in <code>Matplotlib</code> over a <code>Leaflet</code> map using the
<a href="http://leafletjs.com/reference.html#imageoverlay"><code>ImageOverlay</code></a>
functionality. 

<br><br><b>Disclaimer: </b>Everything is an estimate. Rounding errors abound. Don't use this for anything but entertainment and curiosity. But you already know that.
