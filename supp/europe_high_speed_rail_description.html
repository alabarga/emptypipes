The [European high speed rail network
map](/2015/05/11/2015-05-12-europe-high-speed-rail/) was made stochastically.
Connection information for trains between every city in the [European isochrone
maps post](/2015/05/19/2015-05-14-europe-isochrone-map/) and about 50000 other
stations in Europe was obtained using the [Swiss public transport
API](http://transport.opendata.ch/). This data contained information about 
train lines as well as the different stops on the route between two cities.
Taking the longest route obtained for each train line (i.e. ICE 27, RJ 180, etc...)
provided the initial data set.


Since this data included many regional, Intercity, and Eurocity trains, the 
obtained lines were filtered for trains from Spains AVE (Alta Velocidad Española),
France's TGV (Train à Grande Vitesse), Germany's ICE (Intercity-Express), Austria's
Railjet, Italy's ES (mostly not high speed, but...) and the Eurostar trains.
