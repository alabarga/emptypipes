#### Bio ####

My name is Peter and I'm a PhD student working on modelling the tertiary structure of RNA molecules at the [Theoretical Biochemistry Group](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at) at the University of Vienna. 

#### Software ####

* [forgi](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~pkerp/forgi) - A library for annotating and manipulating RNA secondary structure.
* [bwa-pssm](http://bwa-pssm.binf.ku.dk/) - A short read aligner using position-specific scoring matrices to encode the error probabilities for each base.
