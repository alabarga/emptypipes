#### Bio ####

My name is Peter Kerpedjiev and I'm a PhD student working on modelling the tertiary structure of RNA molecules. This blog-like thingy is supposed to document various problems and solutions I've encountered.

#### Software ####

* [forgi](http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/~pkerp/forgi) - A library for annotating and manipulating RNA secondary structure.
* [bwa-pssm](http://bwa-pssm.binf.ku.dk/) - A short read aligner using position-specific scoring matrices to encode the error probabilities for each base.
