Both at home and at work I use some distribution of linux with Xfce as the window manager. Over the years, I've added various shortcuts to speed up the things I do often. The most important of them are the keyboard shortcuts for launching applications. These are set by going to `Settings` -> `Keyboard` and then opening the `Application Shortcuts` tab. In there, my three most used programs are assigned the following shortcuts:

| Application           | Shortcut               |
|:--------------------- | ----------------------:|
| `gnome_terminal`      | `<Alt> F1`             |
| `chromium-browser`    | `<Alt> F3`             |
| `thunar`              | `<Alt> F5`             |
